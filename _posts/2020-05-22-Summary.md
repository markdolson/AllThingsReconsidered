# Housing:
Conor Dougherty’s new book Golden Gates: Fighting for Housing in America is a superb blend of colorful political reporting and deep socioeconomic analysis.  Dougherty, a New York Times economics reporter currently living with his family in Oakland, California, weaves together contemporary narratives and historical perspective to show how the San Francisco Bay Area has become the epicenter of our nation’s failure to provide adequate housing for our populace.  Spoiler alert: liberals are as much to blame as anyone for this state of affairs.

California has the dubious distinction of having some of the highest wages in America and also the highest state poverty rate (when the cost of housing is included).  The core problem is that the state has developed a catastrophic shortage of housing in places where people (and companies) want to be located.  This shortfall has been accruing for many decades and is currently estimated to be well over three million housing units.

In the years following World War II, the obvious way to meet the nation’s growing housing need was to create endless seas of suburbs.  Many industrial operations were drawn to suburban settings as well (and, as an added bonus, Blacks were largely excluded).  As someone who grew up one of these 1950s neighborhoods, I can attest to the enormous pleasure that my working-class father derived from being able to raise his family in such “safe” and refreshingly green surroundings.

This solution had enormous hidden costs, though.  Established suburban communities found increasingly innovative (and self-righteous) ways of prohibiting further housing construction, and this led to ever-worsening “urban sprawl,” extreme commuting, and increasingly problematic use of natural resources.  By the 1970s, this had the further unintended consequence of dramatically driving up prices and turning existing homes into vital financial investments to be protected at all costs.  The only immediate downside to this trend lay in skyrocketing suburban property taxes, and these were conveniently reined in by the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978.

The obvious (and also smarter, greener, and inherently less costly) alternative to this ultimately short-sighted suburban solution was to create denser urban areas.  Not only have we failed to pursue this path (because nobody ever welcomes denser housing into their community), but cities have increasingly become the locus of the most desirable jobs, and the existing supply of urban housing is now woefully inadequate for the existing demand.  The market has responded with crazily escalating housing prices, and companies have similarly responded by increasing salaries for those workers that they value most.

But this has created an urban environment in which: (a) essential service workers can no longer afford to buy a home, (b) renters are perpetually at risk of being driven out by higher rents and/or profitable redevelopment opportunities, and (c) the poorest residents are literally living in the streets – a scenario that was unthinkable in the nation that I grew up in.  Governmental interventions such as rent control, housing subsidies, and a higher minimum wage can all have a positive impact, but our current predicament can ultimately only be remedied with literally millions of new housing units.  Unfortunately, incorporating these into established urban communities is almost as politically challenging as incorporating them into established suburban communities.

The Bay Area today is home to a growing YIMBY movement that is pushing for the construction of new, higher-density, mixed housing in judiciously-targeted urban areas.  However, they continue to face substantial obstacles: high construction costs, extreme legal battles, and odd-bedfellow political alliances between wealthy interests (who want to maximally profit from the current high demand) and the urban poor (who fear being displaced by gentrification).

There are larger lessons in all of this as well.  One recurring theme is that the cohesive world views that intellectuals strive so hard to develop and maintain invariably fail to provide us with adequate guidance in wrestling with complex societal issues that we ourselves have a vested interest in the immediate outcome of.   Independent of whether one favors a more capitalist or a more socialist approach, it is far too easy to think of reasons to resist new housing development in your immediate vicinity.

Another important lesson here is that geographical segregation and social stratification are perpetual threats to a democratic society.  Living apart from others, even if we continue to believe that we have their best interests at heart, makes it nearly impossible for us to: (a) truly understand their experiences and the impacts of our various well-intended interventions, and (b) build effective coalitions that can promote the development of more organic interventions in which everyone is mutually invested.
