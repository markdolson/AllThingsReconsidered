# Overview:
The single most pernicious misconception that I embraced for the first sixty years of my life was my foundational assumption that our society would gradually become ever more enlightened and ever more successful in promoting the common good.  In retrospect, of course, this seems like utter lunacy, but please allow me to say a few words in my defense!

I was certainly not oblivious to the rising tide of economic inequality and to the festering pockets of tribalism and authoritarianism throughout the U.S. and around the world.  Nor was I unaware of the growing challenges posed by global climate change and, more generally, the need to transition to more sustainable ways of living.  I even knew that liberals were messing up bigtime.  Nevertheless, I still found it comfortable to assume that the steadily rising tide of universal education would eventually carry us all to some higher plane of existence.

If I had been thinking more empirically, I might have noticed that there is no historical precedent for such a sustained ascent.  Golden eras come, and golden eras go, and the upward arc of civilization is discernible only over centuries, not mere decades.  But I was born into a world where this kind of optimism was pervasive.  There was an overwhelming consensus that we were finally figuring out how to bring together effective government and science to build a better life for all.  Moreover, as I increasingly immersed myself in academia and the high-tech industry, I continued to encounter ample evidence that this could be true.  Lastly, there is still a lot to be said for maintaining an optimistic perspective on life, no matter what.

Today, though, I have to acknowledge that the vulnerabilities in our rapidly-weakening socioeconomic system were far more profound than I suspected.  I also have to acknowledge that the missteps of my liberal, well-educated cohort were far more detrimental than I initially believed.  My goal in the pages to follow will be to try to take stock of what I have belatedly learned from this experience.
