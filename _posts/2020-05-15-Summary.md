# Fundamentals
Just one more thing, before I begin … I have an inordinate fondness for anchoring my observations in a coherent overarching framework even though: (1) such frameworks can easily seduce us into lazy and misguided thinking, and (2) readers find it far easier to engage with concrete examples than with abstract formulations.  Please indulge me then as I try, as briefly as possible, to explain where I am coming from, in case this matters to you.  I promise that my subsequent reflections will all be more immediately accessible.
All adults experience themselves as lifelong learners, but some people objectively embrace this agenda far more effectively than others.  Similarly, all adults experience themselves as logical decision-makers, but there is enormous variability in their actual performance.  In the end, our individual competence in these two critical domains tends to mirror that of those immediately around us because human intelligence is almost exclusively a collective phenomenon – we are hyper-dependent on input from others both to expose us to new possibilities and to help us test our own provisional assessments.
Unfortunately, the problem that we are now facing is that the increasing stratification of our society, driven both by the widening education/wealth gap and by the segregating tendencies of contemporary media, is preventing us from developing and maintaining a coherent and widely-shared set of core intellectual competencies and understandings.  Consequently, many people are reverting to objectively more primitive ways of thinking about the world around them while many others are settling for insufficiently tested assessments of their comfortable beliefs.
My overly optimistic belief in the power of universal education failed to adequately account for this fatal societal bifurcation.  In the U.S. today, neither education nor governmental expertise is universally valued.  Both are (correctly) perceived to confer only highly-selective benefits.  I am therefore pessimistic about our ability to adequately change course until we succeed in rebuilding a common bond and a shared commitment that reunites the well-educated, urban, upper middle class and the less-well-educated, less-urban, working class.
Ironically, this is precisely the opposite of what certain people mean when they talk about “making America great again!”  In reality, the pre-Vietnam America of my childhood was rife with injustice and beset with plenty of contentious issues.  But there was also a very strong sense of “we’re all in this together.”  Some of this was surely due to the specter of annihilation at the hands of the Soviet Union (which itself came on the heels of the Great Depression and World War II), and some of it was surely facilitated by the economic hegemony of the United States (which made it easier for corporations to be simultaneously profitable and civic-minded).  The upshot was that there was a willingness to provide at least some essential management of our capitalist system.
This last point is paramount because it is a core tenet of my belief system that capitalism is badly in need of precisely such management.  Capitalism has delivered great benefit to the world in recent centuries.  However, left to its own devices, capitalism tends to transform workers into raw material, citizens into mere consumers, and the environment into a garbage dump.  Nor are free markets any sort of panacea.  There are many scenarios in which markets fail to incentivize important societal needs, and there are many other scenarios in which markets severely distort incentives.
In more recent decades, the U.S. has lost the will to adequately manage capitalism, and the results have been calamitous for all but the most resourceful.  It does not necessarily follow from this, though, that capitalism needs to be replaced wholesale.  One reason for this is that we have already demonstrated some previous success with a less drastic solution (namely, managed capitalism).  Another reason, though, is that we can often devise effective patches even when we can’t engage with root causes—this is a classic case of not letting the pursuit of the perfect be the enemy of the good.  In my next two entries, I want to explore two interesting examples of precisely these kinds of patches.
