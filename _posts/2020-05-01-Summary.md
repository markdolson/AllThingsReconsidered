# Introduction
As I near age 65, I am finding myself less and less interested in (and, frankly, less capable of) engaging the competitive battle anew each day, of working shoulder-to-shoulder with my fellow team members to be first to market with some glorious, new, highly-sophisticated, collaborative contribution to our consumer society.  It’s not that I regret any of my earlier efforts – it’s just that it’s time for something different.  I still very much want to contribute, but I’m entering a phase of my life in which my contributions need to be more selective, more reflective, and perhaps more from the sidelines than from the playing field.

In particular, what I’m finding myself increasingly motivated by is the pleasure of discovering all the things that I have been wrong about!  Of course, some of these discoveries come for free with the passage of time, but many of them require a certain obsessive inquisitiveness along with adequate time and resources to commit to this pursuit.  In the end, we are all doomed to live out our lives with no end of unidentified misconceptions, but each one of these that we can ferret out and revise is a precious gift.
